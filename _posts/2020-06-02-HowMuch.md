## No Cop Money.
I've used public records to compile a list of contributions from the Houston Police Officer's Union PAC, the political wing of the HPOU. Police unions are fundamentally anti-justice institutions that exist to protect public servants from the consequences of their actions, which often include violence and murder.								

Contributions from police unions give them power over elected officials, and this is most immediately felt in local & municipal government. The #NoCopMoney campaign is asking for local politicians across the country to swear off of cop money, so that they can put the interests of their community first without being swayed by political contributions. 		

## How much has each member of City Council taken?
All information below can be found on the [master spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n62LkuxhkhLRrmdSMixKzL5Rxz7GDGVpWQxgLsx1jdc/edit#gid=0)

## What can I do? 

Of particular interest are the following members, who self-describe as liberal or progressive and could be easily convinced to turn over their cop money to the people:

If we can convince these six members to donate their money, we will reclaim over $30,000 and set a powerful precedent for Democratic officials in Houston: no. cop. money.

My challenge to you is to **call, email, or mail all five of the above members of Houston City Council.** I have provided a script below to give you guidance:

_"Dear [Member], 								
I am emailing (or calling) you today because you have taken ($$$ amount) from the Houston Police Officers Union between January 2019 and now.	Given the rampant murder of black Americans at the hands of the police, and the role that police unions play in facilitating this violence and protecting	those who carry it out, it is wrong for our elected officials to be taking their money and potentially having their governance decisions swayed. If you are committed to racial justice and building an America free of state-sponsored violence, then it is incumbent upon you to donate the ($$$ amount) you have	received from the Houston Police Officer's Union to the Texas Organizing Project Bail Fund, or a similar community organization fighting for black lives."_
