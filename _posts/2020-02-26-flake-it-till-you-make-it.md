## No Cop Money.
I've used public records to compile a list of contributions from the Houston Police Officer's Union PAC, the political wing of the HPOU. Police unions are fundamentally anti-justice institutions that exist to protect public servants from the consequences of their actions, which often include violence and murder.								

Contributions from police unions give them power over elected officials, and this is most immediately felt in local & municipal government. The #NoCopMoney campaign is asking for local politicians across the country to swear off of cop money, so that they can put the interests of their community first without being swayed by political contributions.
